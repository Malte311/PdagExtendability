There are graphs with 256 nodes each in the subfolder `n=256`

100000 nodes each.

All graphs are extendable (in fact, they are already DAGs).

### `sparse`
This folder contains sparse DAGs. All of the graphs in the subfolder
`small` were generated via the function
[`random_dag`](https://github.com/Malte311/PdagExtendability/blob/master/src/utils/dag_generator.jl#L20)
with parameters `random_dag(20, 30, 50, 55, 0.01)` and have about
1000 nodes each.
The graphs in the subfolder `medium` were generated via
`random_dag(100, 120, 90, 95, 0.001)` and have about 10000 nodes
each.
The maximum degree of graphs in the subfolders `small` and `medium`
lies between 20 and 30 (i.e., no vertex has a degree greater than 30).
The graphs in the subfolder `large` were generated via
`random_dag(500, 520, 190, 195, 0.00005)` and have about 100000 nodes
each. The maximum degree of these graphs is always between 15 and 20.

node). The graphs in the subfolder `n=512` have 512 nodes each. There
are two graphs with ~20% of the edges being directed (those with `p=0.2` in
their name), two graphs with ~25% directed edges (`p=0.25`), and two graphs
with ~30% directed edges (`p=0.3`).

Analogously, the subfolder `n=750` contains complete graphs with 750 nodes
each.

This folder contains complete path graphs, i.e., graphs containing a directed
path through all nodes with all other possible edges being undirected.
The graphs in the subfolder `n=512` have 512 nodes each and represent exactly
the same graph - only the numbering of the nodes is different.

### `erdosrenyi`
This folder contains graphs generated by the
[Erdős–Rényi model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model).
There are graphs with 1000 nodes each in the subfolder `n=1000`
and nodes with 10000 nodes each in the subfolder `n=10000`. The
filename gives further information about the used parameters:
`p1=...` is the probability for having an edge in the
Erdős–Rényi model, `p2=...` the probability for an edge to be
directed (i.e., `1-p2` is the probability for an edge to be
undirected) and `seed` the seed for the random component of the
Erdős–Rényi model.

All graphs are **not** extendable.

### `fromchordal`
This folder contains random PDAGs which were generated by directing edges randomly
in fully undirected chordal graphs. The graphs in the subfolder `subtree-n=10000-1`
have been generated using the undirected chordal graph `subtree-n=10000-1` as a
starting point. Given the undirected chordal graph, all incident edges for a node
have been directed towards that node with a given probability (`p=0.1` for 10%,
`p=0.2` for 20% and so on). For each probability, there are five instances. 

Analogously, the subfolder `subtree-n=10000-2` contains graphs that were generated
using the undirected chordal graph `subtree-n=10000-2` as a basis.

All graphs are extendable.

### `sparse`
This folder contains sparse PDAGs. The subfolder `n=1024` contains
graphs with 1024 nodes and the subfolder `n=10000` contains graphs
with 10000 nodes each. The `p=...` in the filename gives the
probability of an edge being directed (thus, `1-p` is the probability
of an edge being directed).

All graphs are extendable.

The `undirected` subdirectory contains fully undirected input graphs.
